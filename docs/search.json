    "text": "Project Context\nIronman results files are often hard to analyze directly because times can appear in different formats and some rows represent DNFs or missing splits. The goal is to provide a reliable workflow that cleans triathlon data and then communicates insights interactively. Success is measured by correct parsing and filtering of results, clear summary outputs, and a simple upload-to-insight user experience in Streamlit."

    "text": "Methodology\n\nData acquisition:\n\nThe app reads the uploaded CSV using pandas (pd.read_csv(uploaded)), then copies the data into a working dataframe for transformations. Original data was complied from multiple sources.\n\nCleaning pipeline:\n\nTime parsing: parse_time_to_seconds() converts time strings into seconds for all TIME_COLS, handling mm:ss and hh:mm:ss and returning NaN on malformed values.\nTransitions: creates Transitions (sec) as T1 + T2 when available.\nGender normalization: normalize_gender() maps m/f variants to Male/Female and title-cases other values.\nFinisher logic: sets Finished to Overall Time (sec) present and greater than 0, and if a Finish column exists, additionally requires FIN.\n\nAnalysis workflow:\n\nParticipant summary: total participants, finishers, DNFs, and Male/Female counts.\nGeography: continent pie chart with small groups bundled into Other.\nPerformance tables: top 3 athletes per gender by overall time (finishers only), showing split and transitions breakdowns.\nDiscipline impact: correlation of each discipline with overall time, selecting the highest correlation as the “best predictor.”\nBenchmarks: typical finisher (closest to median overall time), slowest finisher profile, and slowest split times that still finished.\nExtra diagnostics: transitions vs overall scatter plot with correlation; age-group median times from Division patterns like M25-29 and F30-34.\n\nTooling:\n\nPackages: Python with pandas, numpy, regex, Streamlit, and matplotlib.\nReproducibility is supported and rerunnable on any dataset with the expected columns."

    "text": "Discussion & Next Steps\nThis app works well for exploring results and getting benchmarks, but it assumes the CSV uses the expected column names and it does not fully check that all splits add up correctly.\nSome next steps: - Add a few quick tests to make sure time parsing and the “Finished” rule work every time - Improve the country to continent mapping, or let users upload their own mapping - Add simple checks (no negative times, no missing key splits, splits roughly match overall time)\nOverall, the project turns raw Ironman results into clean, trustworthy summaries that athletes can quickly use to understand performance and set realistic goals."

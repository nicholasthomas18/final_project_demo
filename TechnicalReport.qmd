## Executive Summary

This project delivers a Streamlit app and supporting Python functions to clean Ironman results data and generate practical performance insights. The app reports participation counts, continent breakdowns, top finishers by gender, which discipline correlates most with overall time, and benchmarks for a typical finisher and the slowest finisher. The main value is turning messy race result exports into consistent, interpretable summaries.

## Project Context

Ironman results files are often hard to analyze directly because times can appear in different formats and some rows represent DNFs or missing splits. The goal is to provide a reliable workflow that cleans triathlon data and then communicates insights interactively. Success is measured by correct parsing and filtering of results, clear summary outputs, and a simple upload-to-insight user experience in Streamlit.

## Data Sources

- _Primary dataset:_ St. George Ironman https://www.coachcox.co.uk/imstats/race/22/results/ 
- _Supplementary data:_ Ironman Races https://www.ironman.com/races?utm_source=discontinued-website&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=oldraces&facet%5B1%5D=region%3ANorth%20America 
- _Data access notes:_ Data are provided by the user at runtime. No automated refresh or external API calls are used. 

## Methodology

1. _Data acquisition:_ 
    - The app reads the uploaded CSV using pandas (pd.read_csv(uploaded)), then copies the data into a working dataframe for transformations. Original data was complied from multiple sources.
    
2. _Cleaning pipeline:_ 

    - Time parsing: parse_time_to_seconds() converts time strings into seconds for all TIME_COLS, handling mm:ss and hh:mm:ss and returning NaN on malformed values.

    - Transitions: creates Transitions (sec) as T1 + T2 when available.

    - Gender normalization: normalize_gender() maps m/f variants to Male/Female and title-cases other values.

    - Finisher logic: sets Finished to Overall Time (sec) present and greater than 0, and if a Finish column exists, additionally requires FIN.

3. _Analysis workflow:_ 
    - Participant summary: total participants, finishers, DNFs, and Male/Female counts.

    - Geography: continent pie chart with small groups bundled into Other.

    - Performance tables: top 3 athletes per gender by overall time (finishers only), showing split and transitions breakdowns.

    - Discipline impact: correlation of each discipline with overall time, selecting the highest correlation as the “best predictor.”

    - Benchmarks: typical finisher (closest to median overall time), slowest finisher profile, and slowest split times that still finished.

    - Extra diagnostics: transitions vs overall scatter plot with correlation; age-group median times from Division patterns like M25-29 and F30-34.

4. _Tooling:_ 
    - Packages: Python with pandas, numpy, regex, Streamlit, and matplotlib. 
    - Reproducibility is supported and rerunnable on any dataset with the expected columns.

## Results & Diagnostics

The app provides summary statistics and figures to analyze triathlon times. Statistics include:
    - Number of Participants
    - Male / Female Ratio
    - Best Predictor of Overall Time 
    - Preparation Insights

Examples can be found [here](Tutorial.qmd).


## Discussion & Next Steps

This app works well for exploring results and getting benchmarks, but it assumes the CSV uses the expected column names and it does not fully check that all splits add up correctly.

Some next steps:
    - Add a few quick tests to make sure time parsing and the “Finished” rule work every time
    - Improve the country to continent mapping, or let users upload their own mapping
    - Add simple checks (no negative times, no missing key splits, splits roughly match overall time)

Overall, the project turns raw Ironman results into clean, trustworthy summaries that athletes can quickly use to understand performance and set realistic goals.
